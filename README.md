# Sales-Performance-Report-DQLab-Store

This project describes the sales performance in DQLab Store from 2009 to 2012.

I created the analysis using python and ran the codes in Google Collab. 
Also, how about the data visualization? I created it in PowerBI Desktop. For the dashboard file, you can check in the notebook.py file.

This is the dataset I used:
